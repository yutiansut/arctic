             This is useful for batch jobs which read-modify-write and don't want to clash with

    (e.g. ConnectionFailure) as this might be indicative of socket failures
  * Bugfix: return 'deleted' state in VersionStore.list_versions() so that
    callers can pick up on the head version being the delete-sentinel.

### 1.10 (2015-10-28)

  * Bugfix: VersionStore.read(date_range=...) could do the wrong thing with
    TimeZones (which aren't yet supported for date_range slicing.).

    This is to workaround that until we work out what the issue is.

### 1.6 (2015-09-16)

  * Feature: Add support for multi-index Bitemporal DataFrame storage.
    This allows persisting data and changes within the DataFrame making it
    easier to see how old data has been revised over time.
  * Bugfix: Ensure we call the error logging hook when exceptions occur

### 1.5 (2015-09-02)
